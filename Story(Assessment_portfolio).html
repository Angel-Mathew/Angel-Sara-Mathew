  <p> <b>The summary of <u>Lost and Found</u>:The mother left to collect food leaving the 
    chick in the cavity of the tree. As she was flying, the rain began pouring down, 
    she flew even farther, but inside her, an uneasy feeling appeared: a cry for help.
     Unable to go further, she returned that time she saw the place had flooded,
    <br> and the tree where the chick was staying was halfway filled, trapping the chick. Now she is in a dilemma: if she tries to pick the chick, it might slip and fall into the water; or if she lets the chick stay, 
    the tree could break or the chick could starve.</b> </p>

         the rabbit out. After a month, Olivia found Poppy thumping on his hind legs near her father,
